The next day sat Zarathustra again on the stone in front of his cave,
whilst his animals roved about in the world outside to bring home new
food,--also new honey: for Zarathustra had spent and wasted the old
honey to the very last particle. When he thus sat, however, with a
stick in his hand, tracing the shadow of his figure on the earth, and
reflecting--verily! not upon himself and his shadow,--all at once he
startled and shrank back: for he saw another shadow beside his own.
And when he hastily looked around and stood up, behold, there stood the
soothsayer beside him, the same whom he had once given to eat and drink
at his table, the proclaimer of the great weariness, who taught: â€œAll is
alike, nothing is worth while, the world is without meaning, knowledge
strangleth.â€ But his face had changed since then; and when Zarathustra
looked into his eyes, his heart was startled once more: so much evil
announcement and ashy-grey lightnings passed over that countenance.

The soothsayer, who had perceived what went on in Zarathustraâ€™s soul,
wiped his face with his hand, as if he would wipe out the impression;
the same did also Zarathustra. And when both of them had thus silently
composed and strengthened themselves, they gave each other the hand, as
a token that they wanted once more to recognise each other.

â€œWelcome hither,â€ said Zarathustra, â€œthou soothsayer of the great
weariness, not in vain shalt thou once have been my messmate and guest.
Eat and drink also with me to-day, and forgive it that a cheerful old
man sitteth with thee at table!â€--â€œA cheerful old man?â€ answered the
soothsayer, shaking his head, â€œbut whoever thou art, or wouldst be, O
Zarathustra, thou hast been here aloft the longest time,--in a little
while thy bark shall no longer rest on dry land!â€--â€œDo I then rest
on dry land?â€--asked Zarathustra, laughing.--â€œThe waves around thy
mountain,â€ answered the soothsayer, â€œrise and rise, the waves of great
distress and affliction: they will soon raise thy bark also and carry
thee away.â€--Thereupon was Zarathustra silent and wondered.--â€œDost thou
still hear nothing?â€ continued the soothsayer: â€œdoth it not rush and
roar out of the depth?â€--Zarathustra was silent once more and listened:
then heard he a long, long cry, which the abysses threw to one another
and passed on; for none of them wished to retain it: so evil did it
sound.

â€œThou ill announcer,â€ said Zarathustra at last, â€œthat is a cry of
distress, and the cry of a man; it may come perhaps out of a black sea.
But what doth human distress matter to me! My last sin which hath been
reserved for me,--knowest thou what it is called?â€

--â€œPITY!â€ answered the soothsayer from an overflowing heart, and raised
both his hands aloft--â€œO Zarathustra, I have come that I may seduce thee
to thy last sin!â€--

And hardly had those words been uttered when there sounded the cry
once more, and longer and more alarming than before--also much nearer.
â€œHearest thou? Hearest thou, O Zarathustra?â€ called out the soothsayer,
â€œthe cry concerneth thee, it calleth thee: Come, come, come; it is time,
it is the highest time!â€--

Zarathustra was silent thereupon, confused and staggered; at last he
asked, like one who hesitateth in himself: â€œAnd who is it that there
calleth me?â€

â€œBut thou knowest it, certainly,â€ answered the soothsayer warmly, â€œwhy
dost thou conceal thyself? It is THE HIGHER MAN that crieth for thee!â€

â€œThe higher man?â€ cried Zarathustra, horror-stricken: â€œwhat wanteth HE?
What wanteth HE? The higher man! What wanteth he here?â€--and his skin
covered with perspiration.

The soothsayer, however, did not heed Zarathustraâ€™s alarm, but listened
and listened in the downward direction. When, however, it had been still
there for a long while, he looked behind, and saw Zarathustra standing
trembling.

â€œO Zarathustra,â€ he began, with sorrowful voice, â€œthou dost not stand
there like one whose happiness maketh him giddy: thou wilt have to dance
lest thou tumble down!

But although thou shouldst dance before me, and leap all thy side-leaps,
no one may say unto me: â€˜Behold, here danceth the last joyous man!â€™

In vain would any one come to this height who sought HIM here: caves
would he find, indeed, and back-caves, hiding-places for hidden ones;
but not lucky mines, nor treasure-chambers, nor new gold-veins of
happiness.

Happiness--how indeed could one find happiness among such buried-alive
and solitary ones! Must I yet seek the last happiness on the Happy
Isles, and far away among forgotten seas?

But all is alike, nothing is worth while, no seeking is of service,
there are no longer any Happy Isles!â€--

Thus sighed the soothsayer; with his last sigh, however, Zarathustra
again became serene and assured, like one who hath come out of a deep
chasm into the light. â€œNay! Nay! Three times Nay!â€ exclaimed he with a
strong voice, and stroked his beard--â€œTHAT do I know better! There are
still Happy Isles! Silence THEREON, thou sighing sorrow-sack!

Cease to splash THEREON, thou rain-cloud of the forenoon! Do I not
already stand here wet with thy misery, and drenched like a dog?

Now do I shake myself and run away from thee, that I may again become
dry: thereat mayest thou not wonder! Do I seem to thee discourteous?
Here however is MY court.

But as regards the higher man: well! I shall seek him at once in those
forests: FROM THENCE came his cry. Perhaps he is there hard beset by an
evil beast.

He is in MY domain: therein shall he receive no scath! And verily, there
are many evil beasts about me.â€--

With those words Zarathustra turned around to depart. Then said the
soothsayer: â€œO Zarathustra, thou art a rogue!

I know it well: thou wouldst fain be rid of me! Rather wouldst thou run
into the forest and lay snares for evil beasts!

But what good will it do thee? In the evening wilt thou have me again:
in thine own cave will I sit, patient and heavy like a block--and wait
for thee!â€

â€œSo be it!â€ shouted back Zarathustra, as he went away: â€œand what is mine
in my cave belongeth also unto thee, my guest!

Shouldst thou however find honey therein, well! just lick it up, thou
growling bear, and sweeten thy soul! For in the evening we want both to
be in good spirits;

--In good spirits and joyful, because this day hath come to an end! And
thou thyself shalt dance to my lays, as my dancing-bear.

Thou dost not believe this? Thou shakest thy head? Well! Cheer up, old
bear! But I also--am a soothsayer.â€

Thus spake Zarathustra.




LXIII. TALK WITH THE KINGS.

1.

Ere Zarathustra had been an hour on his way in the mountains and
forests, he saw all at once a strange procession. Right on the path
which he was about to descend came two kings walking, bedecked with
crowns and purple girdles, and variegated like flamingoes: they drove
before them a laden ass. â€œWhat do these kings want in my domain?â€ said
Zarathustra in astonishment to his heart, and hid himself hastily behind
a thicket. When however the kings approached to him, he said half-aloud,
like one speaking only to himself: â€œStrange! Strange! How doth this
harmonise? Two kings do I see--and only one ass!â€

Thereupon the two kings made a halt; they smiled and looked towards the
spot whence the voice proceeded, and afterwards looked into each otherâ€™s
faces. â€œSuch things do we also think among ourselves,â€ said the king on
the right, â€œbut we do not utter them.â€

The king on the left, however, shrugged his shoulders and answered:
â€œThat may perhaps be a goat-herd. Or an anchorite who hath lived too
long among rocks and trees. For no society at all spoileth also good
manners.â€

â€œGood manners?â€ replied angrily and bitterly the other king: â€œwhat
then do we run out of the way of? Is it not â€˜good mannersâ€™? Our â€˜good
societyâ€™?

Better, verily, to live among anchorites and goat-herds, than with
our gilded, false, over-rouged populace--though it call itself â€˜good
society.â€™

--Though it call itself â€˜nobility.â€™ But there all is false and foul,
above all the blood--thanks to old evil diseases and worse curers.

The best and dearest to me at present is still a sound peasant, coarse,
artful, obstinate and enduring: that is at present the noblest type.

The peasant is at present the best; and the peasant type should be
master! But it is the kingdom of the populace--I no longer allow
anything to be imposed upon me. The populace, however--that meaneth,
hodgepodge.

Populace-hodgepodge: therein is everything mixed with everything, saint
and swindler, gentleman and Jew, and every beast out of Noahâ€™s ark.

Good manners! Everything is false and foul with us. No one knoweth any
longer how to reverence: it is THAT precisely that we run away from.
They are fulsome obtrusive dogs; they gild palm-leaves.

This loathing choketh me, that we kings ourselves have become false,
draped and disguised with the old faded pomp of our ancestors,
show-pieces for the stupidest, the craftiest, and whosoever at present
trafficketh for power.

We ARE NOT the first men--and have nevertheless to STAND FOR them: of
this imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted.

From the rabble have we gone out of the way, from all those bawlers and
scribe-blowflies, from the trader-stench, the ambition-fidgeting, the
bad breath--: fie, to live among the rabble;

--Fie, to stand for the first men among the rabble! Ah, loathing!
Loathing! Loathing! What doth it now matter about us kings!â€--

â€œThine old sickness seizeth thee,â€ said here the king on the left, â€œthy
loathing seizeth thee, my poor brother. Thou knowest, however, that some
one heareth us.â€

Immediately thereupon, Zarathustra, who had opened ears and eyes to this
talk, rose from his hiding-place, advanced towards the kings, and thus
began:

â€œHe who hearkeneth unto you, he who gladly hearkeneth unto you, is
called Zarathustra.

I am Zarathustra who once said: â€˜What doth it now matter about kings!â€™
Forgive me; I rejoiced when ye said to each other: â€˜What doth it matter
about us kings!â€™

Here, however, is MY domain and jurisdiction: what may ye be seeking in
my domain? Perhaps, however, ye have FOUND on your way what _I_ seek:
namely, the higher man.â€

When the kings heard this, they beat upon their breasts and said with
one voice: â€œWe are recognised!

With the sword of thine utterance severest thou the thickest darkness of
our hearts. Thou hast discovered our distress; for lo! we are on our way
to find the higher man--

--The man that is higher than we, although we are kings. To him do we
convey this ass. For the highest man shall also be the highest lord on
earth.

There is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny, than when the mighty
of the earth are not also the first men. Then everything becometh false
and distorted and monstrous.

And when they are even the last men, and more beast than man, then
riseth and riseth the populace in honour, and at last saith even the
populace-virtue: â€˜Lo, I alone am virtue!â€™â€--

What have I just heard? answered Zarathustra. What wisdom in kings! I
am enchanted, and verily, I have already promptings to make a rhyme
thereon:--

--Even if it should happen to be a rhyme not suited for every oneâ€™s
ears. I unlearned long ago to have consideration for long ears. Well
then! Well now!

(Here, however, it happened that the ass also found utterance: it said
distinctly and with malevolence, Y-E-A.)

â€˜Twas once--methinks year one of our blessed Lord,--Drunk without wine,
the Sybil thus deplored:--â€œHow ill things go! Decline! Decline! Neâ€™er
sank the world so low! Rome now hath turned harlot and harlot-stew,
Romeâ€™s Caesar a beast, and God--hath turned Jew!
