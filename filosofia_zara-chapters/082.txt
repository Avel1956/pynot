Such sayings did I hear pious backworldsmen speak to their consciences,
and verily without wickedness or guile,--although there is nothing more
guileful in the world, or more wicked.

â€œLet the world be as it is! Raise not a finger against it!â€

â€œLet whoever will choke and stab and skin and scrape the people: raise
not a finger against it! Thereby will they learn to renounce the world.â€

â€œAnd thine own reason--this shalt thou thyself stifle and choke; for it
is a reason of this world,--thereby wilt thou learn thyself to renounce
the world.â€--

--Shatter, shatter, O my brethren, those old tables of the pious! Tatter
the maxims of the world-maligners!--
