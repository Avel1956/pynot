Have ye now learned my song? Have ye divined what it would say? Well!
Cheer up! Ye higher men, sing now my roundelay!

Sing now yourselves the song, the name of which is â€œOnce more,â€ the
signification of which is â€œUnto all eternity!â€--sing, ye higher men,
Zarathustraâ€™s roundelay!

     O man!  Take heed!
     What saith deep midnightâ€™s voice indeed?
     â€œI slept my sleep--,
     â€œFrom deepest dream Iâ€™ve woke, and plead:--
     â€œThe world is deep,
     â€œAnd deeper than the day could read.
     â€œDeep is its woe--,
     â€œJoy--deeper still than grief can be:
     â€œWoe saith:  Hence!  Go!
     â€œBut joys all want eternity-,
     â€œ-Want deep, profound eternity!â€
