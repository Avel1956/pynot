â€œWhy should one live? All is vain! To live--that is to thrash straw; to
live--that is to burn oneself and yet not get warm.â€--

Such ancient babbling still passeth for â€œwisdomâ€; because it is old,
however, and smelleth mustily, THEREFORE is it the more honoured. Even
mould ennobleth.--

Children might thus speak: they SHUN the fire because it hath burnt
them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.

And he who ever â€œthrasheth straw,â€ why should he be allowed to rail at
thrashing! Such a fool one would have to muzzle!

Such persons sit down to the table and bring nothing with them, not even
good hunger:--and then do they rail: â€œAll is vain!â€

But to eat and drink well, my brethren, is verily no vain art! Break up,
break up for me the tables of the never-joyous ones!
