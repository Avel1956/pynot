In this discourse we get the best exposition in the whole book of
Nietzscheâ€™s doctrine of the Will to Power. I go into this question
thoroughly in the Note on Chapter LVII.

Nietzsche was not an iconoclast from choice. Those who hastily class him
with the anarchists (or the Progressivists of the last century) fail
to understand the high esteem in which he always held both law and
discipline. In verse 41 of this most decisive discourse he truly
explains his position when he says: â€œ...he who hath to be a creator in
good and evil--verily he hath first to be a destroyer, and break values
in pieces.â€ This teaching in regard to self-control is evidence enough
of his reverence for law.
