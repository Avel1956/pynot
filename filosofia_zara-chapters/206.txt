Here I think I may claim that my contention in regard to the purpose and
aim of the whole of Nietzscheâ€™s philosophy (as stated at the beginning
of my Notes on Part IV.) is completely upheld. He fought for â€œall who
do not want to live, unless they learn again to HOPE--unless THEY learn
(from him) the GREAT hope!â€ Zarathustraâ€™s address to his guests shows
clearly enough how he wished to help them: â€œI DO NOT TREAT MY WARRIORS
INDULGENTLY,â€ he says: â€œhow then could ye be fit for MY warfare?â€ He
rebukes and spurns them, no word of love comes from his lips. Elsewhere
he says a man should be a hard bed to his friend, thus alone can he be
of use to him. Nietzsche would be a hard bed to higher men. He would
make them harder; for, in order to be a law unto himself, man must
possess the requisite hardness. â€œI wait for higher ones, stronger ones,
more triumphant ones, merrier ones, for such as are built squarely in
body and soul.â€ He says in par. 6 of â€œHigher Manâ€:--

â€œYe higher men, think ye that I am here to put right what ye have put
wrong? Or that I wished henceforth to make snugger couches for you
sufferers? Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones new and
easier footpaths?â€

â€œNay! Nay! Three times nay! Always more, always better ones of your type
shall succumb--for ye shall always have it worse and harder.â€
