â€œMan is evilâ€--so said to me for consolation, all the wisest ones. Ah,
if only it be still true to-day! For the evil is manâ€™s best force.

â€œMan must become better and evilerâ€--so do _I_ teach. The evilest is
necessary for the Supermanâ€™s best.

It may have been well for the preacher of the petty people to suffer and
be burdened by menâ€™s sin. I, however, rejoice in great sin as my great
CONSOLATION.--

Such things, however, are not said for long ears. Every word, also,
is not suited for every mouth. These are fine far-away things: at them
sheepâ€™s claws shall not grasp!
