In regard to this discourse, I should only like to point out that
Nietzsche had a particular aversion to the word â€œsuicideâ€--self-murder.
He disliked the evil it suggested, and in rechristening the act
Voluntary Death, i.e., the death that comes from no other hand than
oneâ€™s own, he was desirous of elevating it to the position it held in
classical antiquity (see Aphorism 36 in â€œThe Twilight of the Idolsâ€).
