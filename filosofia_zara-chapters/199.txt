Among the higher men whom Zarathustra wishes to save, is also the
scientific specialist--the man who honestly and scrupulously pursues his
investigations, as Darwin did, in one department of knowledge. â€œI love
him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in order that the
Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own down-going.â€
 â€œThe spiritually conscientious one,â€ he is called in this discourse.
Zarathustra steps on him unawares, and the slave of science, bleeding
from the violence he has done to himself by his self-imposed task,
speaks proudly of his little sphere of knowledge--his little handâ€™s
breadth of ground on Zarathustraâ€™s territory, philosophy. â€œWhere mine
honesty ceaseth,â€ says the true scientific specialist, â€œthere am I blind
and want also to be blind. Where I want to know, however, there want
I also to be honest--namely, severe, rigorous, restricted, cruel, and
inexorable.â€ Zarathustra greatly respecting this man, invites him too to
the cave, and then vanishes in answer to another cry for help.
