â€œThou shalt not rob! Thou shalt not slay!â€--such precepts were once
called holy; before them did one bow the knee and the head, and take off
oneâ€™s shoes.

But I ask you: Where have there ever been better robbers and slayers in
the world than such holy precepts?

Is there not even in all life--robbing and slaying? And for such
precepts to be called holy, was not TRUTH itself thereby--slain?

--Or was it a sermon of death that called holy what contradicted and
dissuaded from life?--O my brethren, break up, break up for me the old
tables!
