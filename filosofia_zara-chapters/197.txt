We now meet with Zarathustra in extraordinary circumstances. He is
confronted with Schopenhauer and tempted by the old Soothsayer to commit
the sin of pity. â€œI have come that I may seduce thee to thy last sin!â€
 says the Soothsayer to Zarathustra. It will be remembered that in
Schopenhauerâ€™s ethics, pity is elevated to the highest place among the
virtues, and very consistently too, seeing that the Weltanschauung is
a pessimistic one. Schopenhauer appeals to Nietzscheâ€™s deepest and
strongest sentiment--his sympathy for higher men. â€œWhy dost thou conceal
thyself?â€ he cries. â€œIt is THE HIGHER MAN that calleth for thee!â€
 Zarathustra is almost overcome by the Soothsayerâ€™s pleading, as he
had been once already in the past, but he resists him step by step. At
length he can withstand him no longer, and, on the plea that the higher
man is on his ground and therefore under his protection, Zarathustra
departs in search of him, leaving Schopenhauer--a higher man in
Nietzscheâ€™s opinion--in the cave as a guest.
