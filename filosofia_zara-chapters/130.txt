If ye would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not get yourselves
CARRIED aloft; do not seat yourselves on other peopleâ€™s backs and heads!

Thou hast mounted, however, on horseback? Thou now ridest briskly up
to thy goal? Well, my friend! But thy lame foot is also with thee on
horseback!

When thou reachest thy goal, when thou alightest from thy horse:
precisely on thy HEIGHT, thou higher man,--then wilt thou stumble!
