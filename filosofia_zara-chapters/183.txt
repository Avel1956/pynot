This seems to me to give an account of the great struggle which must
have taken place in Nietzscheâ€™s soul before he finally resolved to make
known the more esoteric portions of his teaching. Our deepest feelings
crave silence. There is a certain self-respect in the serious man which
makes him hold his profoundest feelings sacred. Before they are uttered
they are full of the modesty of a virgin, and often the oldest sage will
blush like a girl when this virginity is violated by an indiscretion
which forces him to reveal his deepest thoughts.

PART III.

This is perhaps the most important of all the four parts. If it
contained only â€œThe Vision and the Enigmaâ€ and â€œThe Old and New Tablesâ€
 I should still be of this opinion; for in the former of these discourses
we meet with what Nietzsche regarded as the crowning doctrine of his
philosophy and in â€œThe Old and New Tablesâ€ we have a valuable epitome of
practically all his leading principles.
