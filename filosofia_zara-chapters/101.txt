One!

O man! Take heed!

Two!

What saith deep midnightâ€™s voice indeed?

Three!

â€œI slept my sleep--

Four!

â€œFrom deepest dream Iâ€™ve woke and plead:--

Five!

â€œThe world is deep,

Six!

â€œAnd deeper than the day could read.

Seven!

â€œDeep is its woe--

Eight!

â€œJoy--deeper still than grief can be:

Nine!

â€œWoe saith: Hence! Go!

Ten!

â€œBut joys all want eternity--

Eleven!

â€œWant deep profound eternity!â€

Twelve!
