There is an old illusion--it is called good and evil. Around soothsayers
and astrologers hath hitherto revolved the orbit of this illusion.

Once did one BELIEVE in soothsayers and astrologers; and THEREFORE did
one believe, â€œEverything is fate: thou shalt, for thou must!â€

Then again did one distrust all soothsayers and astrologers; and
THEREFORE did one believe, â€œEverything is freedom: thou canst, for thou
willest!â€

O my brethren, concerning the stars and the future there hath hitherto
been only illusion, and not knowledge; and THEREFORE concerning good and
evil there hath hitherto been only illusion and not knowledge!
