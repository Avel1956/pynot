Here we have a record of Zarathustraâ€™s avowal of optimism, as also the
important statement concerning â€œChanceâ€ or â€œAccidentâ€ (verse 27). Those
who are familiar with Nietzscheâ€™s philosophy will not require to be told
what an important role his doctrine of chance plays in his teaching.
The Giant Chance has hitherto played with the puppet â€œman,â€--this is
the fact he cannot contemplate with equanimity. Man shall now exploit
chance, he says again and again, and make it fall on its knees before
him! (See verse 33 in â€œOn the Olive Mountâ€, and verses 9-10 in â€œThe
Bedwarfing Virtueâ€).
