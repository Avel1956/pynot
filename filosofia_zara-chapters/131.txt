Ye creating ones, ye higher men! One is only pregnant with oneâ€™s own
child.

Do not let yourselves be imposed upon or put upon! Who then is YOUR
neighbour? Even if ye act â€œfor your neighbourâ€--ye still do not create
for him!

Unlearn, I pray you, this â€œfor,â€ ye creating ones: your very virtue
wisheth you to have naught to do with â€œforâ€ and â€œon account ofâ€ and
â€œbecause.â€ Against these false little words shall ye stop your ears.

â€œFor oneâ€™s neighbour,â€ is the virtue only of the petty people: there it
is said â€œlike and like,â€ and â€œhand washeth handâ€:--they have neither the
right nor the power for YOUR self-seeking!

In your self-seeking, ye creating ones, there is the foresight and
foreseeing of the pregnant! What no oneâ€™s eye hath yet seen, namely, the
fruit--this, sheltereth and saveth and nourisheth your entire love.

Where your entire love is, namely, with your child, there is also your
entire virtue! Your work, your will is YOUR â€œneighbourâ€: let no false
values impose upon you!
