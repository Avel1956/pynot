In the fourteenth verse of this discourse Nietzsche defines the solemn
duty he imposed upon himself: â€œBecome what thou art.â€ Surely the
criticism which has been directed against this maxim must all fall to
the ground when it is remembered, once and for all, that Nietzscheâ€™s
teaching was never intended to be other than an esoteric one. â€œI am a
law only for mine own,â€ he says emphatically, â€œI am not a law for
all.â€ It is of the greatest importance to humanity that its highest
individuals should be allowed to attain to their full development; for,
only by means of its heroes can the human race be led forward step by
step to higher and yet higher levels. â€œBecome what thou artâ€ applied
to all, of course, becomes a vicious maxim; it is to be hoped, however,
that we may learn in time that the same action performed by a given
number of men, loses its identity precisely that same number of
times.--â€œQuod licet Jovi, non licet bovi.â€

At the last eight verses many readers may be tempted to laugh. In
England we almost always laugh when a man takes himself seriously at
anything save sport. And there is of course no reason why the reader
should not be hilarious.--A certain greatness is requisite, both in
order to be sublime and to have reverence for the sublime. Nietzsche
earnestly believed that the Zarathustra-kingdom--his dynasty of a
thousand years--would one day come; if he had not believed it so
earnestly, if every artist in fact had not believed so earnestly in
his Hazar, whether of ten, fifteen, a hundred, or a thousand years, we
should have lost all our higher men; they would have become pessimists,
suicides, or merchants. If the minor poet and philosopher has made us
shy of the prophetic seriousness which characterized an Isaiah or a
Jeremiah, it is surely our loss and the minor poetâ€™s gain.
