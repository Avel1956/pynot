When the water hath planks, when gangways and railings oâ€™erspan the
stream, verily, he is not believed who then saith: â€œAll is in flux.â€

But even the simpletons contradict him. â€œWhat?â€ say the simpletons, â€œall
in flux? Planks and railings are still OVER the stream!

â€œOVER the stream all is stable, all the values of things, the bridges
and bearings, all â€˜goodâ€™ and â€˜evilâ€™: these are all STABLE!â€--

Cometh, however, the hard winter, the stream-tamer, then learn even the
wittiest distrust, and verily, not only the simpletons then say: â€œShould
not everything--STAND STILL?â€

â€œFundamentally standeth everything stillâ€--that is an appropriate winter
doctrine, good cheer for an unproductive period, a great comfort for
winter-sleepers and fireside-loungers.

â€œFundamentally standeth everything stillâ€--: but CONTRARY thereto,
preacheth the thawing wind!

The thawing wind, a bullock, which is no ploughing bullock--a furious
bullock, a destroyer, which with angry horns breaketh the ice! The ice
however--BREAKETH GANGWAYS!

O my brethren, is not everything AT PRESENT IN FLUX? Have not all
railings and gangways fallen into the water? Who would still HOLD ON to
â€œgoodâ€ and â€œevilâ€?

â€œWoe to us! Hail to us! The thawing wind bloweth!â€--Thus preach, my
brethren, through all the streets!
