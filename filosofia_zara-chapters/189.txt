It is clear that this applies to all those breathless and hasty â€œtasters
of everything,â€ who plunge too rashly into the sea of independent
thought and â€œheresy,â€ and who, having miscalculated their strength, find
it impossible to keep their head above water. â€œA little older, a little
colder,â€ says Nietzsche. They soon clamber back to the conventions of
the age they intended reforming. The French then say â€œle diable se fait
hermite,â€ but these men, as a rule, have never been devils, neither
do they become angels; for, in order to be really good or evil, some
strength and deep breathing is required. Those who are more interested
in supporting orthodoxy than in being over nice concerning the kind of
support they give it, often refer to these people as evidence in favour
of the true faith.
