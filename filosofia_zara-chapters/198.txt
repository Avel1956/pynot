On his way Zarathustra meets two more higher men of his time; two
kings cross his path. They are above the average modern type; for their
instincts tell them what real ruling is, and they despise the mockery
which they have been taught to call â€œReigning.â€ â€œWe ARE NOT the first
men,â€ they say, â€œand have nevertheless to STAND FOR them: of this
imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted.â€ It is the kings
who tell Zarathustra: â€œThere is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny
than when the mighty of the earth are not also the first men. There
everything becometh false and distorted and monstrous.â€ The kings are
also asked by Zarathustra to accept the shelter of his cave, whereupon
he proceeds on his way.
