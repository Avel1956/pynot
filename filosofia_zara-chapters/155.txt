Thou grape-vine! Why dost thou praise me? Have I not cut thee! I am
cruel, thou bleedest--: what meaneth thy praise of my drunken cruelty?

â€œWhatever hath become perfect, everything mature--wanteth to die!â€ so
sayest thou. Blessed, blessed be the vintnerâ€™s knife! But everything
immature wanteth to live: alas!

Woe saith: â€œHence! Go! Away, thou woe!â€ But everything that suffereth
wanteth to live, that it may become mature and lively and longing,

--Longing for the further, the higher, the brighter. â€œI want heirs,â€
 so saith everything that suffereth, â€œI want children, I do not want
MYSELF,â€--

Joy, however, doth not want heirs, it doth not want children,--joy
wanteth itself, it wanteth eternity, it wanteth recurrence, it wanteth
everything eternally-like-itself.

Woe saith: â€œBreak, bleed, thou heart! Wander, thou leg! Thou wing, fly!
Onward! upward! thou pain!â€ Well! Cheer up! O mine old heart: WOE SAITH:
â€œHENCE! GO!â€
