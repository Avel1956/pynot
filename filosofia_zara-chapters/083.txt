â€œHe who learneth much unlearneth all violent cravingsâ€--that do people
now whisper to one another in all the dark lanes.

â€œWisdom wearieth, nothing is worth while; thou shalt not crave!â€--this
new table found I hanging even in the public markets.

Break up for me, O my brethren, break up also that NEW table! The
weary-oâ€™-the-world put it up, and the preachers of death and the jailer:
for lo, it is also a sermon for slavery:--

Because they learned badly and not the best, and everything too early
and everything too fast; because they ATE badly: from thence hath
resulted their ruined stomach;--

--For a ruined stomach, is their spirit: IT persuadeth to death! For
verily, my brethren, the spirit IS a stomach!

Life is a well of delight, but to him in whom the ruined stomach
speaketh, the father of affliction, all fountains are poisoned.

To discern: that is DELIGHT to the lion-willed! But he who hath become
weary, is himself merely â€œwilledâ€; with him play all the waves.

And such is always the nature of weak men: they lose themselves on their
way. And at last asketh their weariness: â€œWhy did we ever go on the way?
All is indifferent!â€

TO THEM soundeth it pleasant to have preached in their ears: â€œNothing is
worth while! Ye shall not will!â€ That, however, is a sermon for slavery.

O my brethren, a fresh blustering wind cometh Zarathustra unto all
way-weary ones; many noses will he yet make sneeze!

Even through walls bloweth my free breath, and in into prisons and
imprisoned spirits!

Willing emancipateth: for willing is creating: so do I teach. And ONLY
for creating shall ye learn!

And also the learning shall ye LEARN only from me, the learning
well!--He who hath ears let him hear!
