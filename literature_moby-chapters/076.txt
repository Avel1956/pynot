Over Him.

It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whaleâ€™s
prodigious head hanging to the Pequodâ€™s side. But we must let it
continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it.
For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the
head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.

Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the
Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to
cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near
the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale
had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the
announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if
opportunity offered.

Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
boats, Stubbâ€™s and Flaskâ€™s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling
further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the
men at the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great
heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that
one or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats
were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship
by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at
first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a
maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from
view, as if diving under the keel. â€œCut, cut!â€ was the cry from the
ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being
brought with a deadly dash against the vesselâ€™s side. But having
plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly,
they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with
all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the
struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the
tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another,
the contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a
few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did
gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning
along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,
suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so
flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken
glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once
more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,
and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing
the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.

Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for
lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the
multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whaleâ€™s
body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking
at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting
fountains that poured from the smitten rock.

At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
turned upon his back a corpse.

While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
conversation ensued between them.

â€œI wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,â€ said
Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
ignoble a leviathan.

â€œWants with it?â€ said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boatâ€™s
bow, â€œdid you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm
Whaleâ€™s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a
Right Whaleâ€™s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that
ship can never afterwards capsize?â€

â€œWhy not?

â€œI donâ€™t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying
so, and he seems to know all about shipsâ€™ charms. But I sometimes
think heâ€™ll charm the ship to no good at last. I donâ€™t half like
that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of
carved into a snakeâ€™s head, Stubb?â€

â€œSink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of
a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look
down there, Flaskâ€â€”pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of
both handsâ€”â€œAye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil
in disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having
been stowed away on board ship? Heâ€™s the devil, I say. The reason why
you donâ€™t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he
carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I
think of it, heâ€™s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his
boots.â€

â€œHe sleeps in his boots, donâ€™t he? He hasnâ€™t got any hammock; but
Iâ€™ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.â€

â€œNo doubt, and itâ€™s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do
ye see, in the eye of the rigging.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s the old man have so much to do with him for?â€

â€œStriking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.â€

â€œBargain?â€”about what?â€

â€œWhy, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and
the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then
heâ€™ll surrender Moby Dick.â€

â€œPooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the
old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he
was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching
his hoofs, up and says, â€˜I want John.â€™ â€˜What for?â€™ says the old
governor. â€˜What business is that of yours,â€™ says the devil, getting
mad,â€”â€˜I want to use him.â€™ â€˜Take him,â€™ says the governorâ€”and
by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didnâ€™t give John the Asiatic cholera
before he got through with him, Iâ€™ll eat this whale in one mouthful.
But look sharpâ€”ainâ€™t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead,
and letâ€™s get the whale alongside.â€

â€œI think I remember some such story as you were telling,â€ said
Flask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their
burden towards the ship, â€œbut I canâ€™t remember where.â€

â€œThree Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes?
Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?â€

â€œNo: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,
Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was
the same you say is now on board the Pequod?â€

â€œAm I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesnâ€™t the devil
live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever
see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a
latch-key to get into the admiralâ€™s cabin, donâ€™t you suppose he can
crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?â€

â€œHow old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?â€

â€œDo you see that mainmast there?â€ pointing to the ship; â€œwell,
thatâ€™s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequodâ€™s hold,
and string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well,
that wouldnâ€™t begin to be Fedallahâ€™s age. Nor all the coopers in
creation couldnâ€™t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.â€

â€œBut see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that
you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if
heâ€™s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going
to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboardâ€”tell me
that?

â€œGive him a good ducking, anyhow.â€

â€œBut heâ€™d crawl back.â€

â€œDuck him again; and keep ducking him.â€

â€œSuppose he should take it into his head to duck you, thoughâ€”yes,
and drown youâ€”what then?â€

â€œI should like to see him try it; Iâ€™d give him such a pair of black
eyes that he wouldnâ€™t dare to show his face in the admiralâ€™s cabin
again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he
lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn
the devil, Flask; so you suppose Iâ€™m afraid of the devil? Whoâ€™s
afraid of him, except the old governor who daresnâ€™t catch him and put
him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping
people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil
kidnapped, heâ€™d roast for him? Thereâ€™s a governor!â€

â€œDo you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?â€

â€œDo I suppose it? Youâ€™ll know it before long, Flask. But I am
going now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very
suspicious going on, Iâ€™ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and
sayâ€”Look here, Beelzebub, you donâ€™t do it; and if he makes any fuss,
by the Lord Iâ€™ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to
the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail
will come short off at the stumpâ€”do you see; and then, I rather guess
when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, heâ€™ll sneak off
without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.â€

â€œAnd what will you do with the tail, Stubb?â€

â€œDo with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;â€”what else?â€

â€œNow, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along,
Stubb?â€

â€œMean or not mean, here we are at the ship.â€

The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where
fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing
him.

â€œDidnâ€™t I tell you so?â€ said Flask; â€œyes, youâ€™ll soon see this
right whaleâ€™s head hoisted up opposite that parmacettiâ€™s.â€

In good time, Flaskâ€™s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod
steeply leaned over towards the sperm whaleâ€™s head, now, by the
counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely
strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in
Lockeâ€™s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist
in Kantâ€™s and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus,
some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these
thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.

In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off
whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and
hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is
called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case,
had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and
the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of
overburdening panniers.

Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whaleâ€™s head, and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow;
while, if the Parseeâ€™s shadow was there at all it seemed only to
blend with, and lengthen Ahabâ€™s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish
speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing
things.
