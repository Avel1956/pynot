It was nearly six oâ€™clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
drew nigh the wharf.

â€œThere are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,â€ said I
to Queequeg, â€œit canâ€™t be shadows; sheâ€™s off by sunrise, I guess;
come on!â€

â€œAvast!â€ cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close
behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating
himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain
twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.

â€œGoing aboard?â€

â€œHands off, will you,â€ said I.

â€œLookee here,â€ said Queequeg, shaking himself, â€œgo â€˜way!â€

â€œAinâ€™t going aboard, then?â€

â€œYes, we are,â€ said I, â€œbut what business is that of yours? Do you
know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?â€

â€œNo, no, no; I wasnâ€™t aware of that,â€ said Elijah, slowly and
wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable
glances.

â€œElijah,â€ said I, â€œyou will oblige my friend and me by
withdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would
prefer not to be detained.â€

â€œYe be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?â€

â€œHeâ€™s cracked, Queequeg,â€ said I, â€œcome on.â€

â€œHolloa!â€ cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a
few paces.

â€œNever mind him,â€ said I, â€œQueequeg, come on.â€

But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
shoulder, saidâ€”â€œDid ye see anything looking like men going towards
that ship a while ago?â€

Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,
â€œYes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be
sure.â€

â€œVery dim, very dim,â€ said Elijah. â€œMorning to ye.â€

Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
touching my shoulder again, said, â€œSee if you can find â€˜em now, will
ye?

â€œFind who?â€

â€œMorning to ye! morning to ye!â€ he rejoined, again moving
off. â€œOh! I was going to warn ye againstâ€”but never mind, never
mindâ€”itâ€™s all one, all in the family too;â€”sharp frost this
morning, ainâ€™t it? Good-bye to ye. Shanâ€™t see ye again very soon,
I guess; unless itâ€™s before the Grand Jury.â€ And with these cracked
words he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small
wonderment at his frantic impudence.

At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward
to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a
light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber
slept upon him.

â€œThose sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?â€ said
I, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the
wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence
I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that
matter, were it not for Elijahâ€™s otherwise inexplicable question. But
I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted
to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him
to establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeperâ€™s
rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more
ado, sat quietly down there.

â€œGracious! Queequeg, donâ€™t sit there,â€ said I.

â€œOh! perry dood seat,â€ said Queequeg, â€œmy country way; wonâ€™t
hurt him face.â€

â€œFace!â€ said I, â€œcall that his face? very benevolent countenance
then; but how hard he breathes, heâ€™s heaving himself; get off,
Queequeg, you are heavy, itâ€™s grinding the face of the poor. Get
off, Queequeg! Look, heâ€™ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he donâ€™t
wake.â€

Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing
over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him
in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his
land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,
chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some
of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in
that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay
them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on
an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible
into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and
desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps
in some damp marshy place.

While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeperâ€™s head.

â€œWhatâ€™s that for, Queequeg?â€

â€œPerry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!â€

He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The
strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began
to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed
troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and
rubbed his eyes.

â€œHolloa!â€ he breathed at last, â€œwho be ye smokers?â€

â€œShipped men,â€ answered I, â€œwhen does she sail?â€

â€œAye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain
came aboard last night.â€

â€œWhat Captain?â€”Ahab?â€

â€œWho but him indeed?â€

I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
heard a noise on deck.

â€œHolloa! Starbuckâ€™s astir,â€ said the rigger. â€œHeâ€™s a lively
chief mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn
to.â€ And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.

It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and
threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly
enshrined within his cabin.
