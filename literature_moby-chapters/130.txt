The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the open
hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted oakum
slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his
frock.â€”Ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip
following him.

â€œBack, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand
complies with my humor more genially than that boy.â€”Middle aisle of a
church! Whatâ€™s here?â€

â€œLife-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuckâ€™s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the
hatchway!â€

â€œThank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.â€

â€œSir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.â€

â€œArt not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy
shop?â€

â€œI believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?â€

â€œWell enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?â€

â€œAye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
theyâ€™ve set me now to turning it into something else.â€

â€œThen tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the
next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
jack-of-all-trades.â€

â€œBut I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.â€

â€œThe gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a
coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the
craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in
hand. Dost thou never?â€

â€œSing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, Iâ€™m indifferent enough, sir, for that;
but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because
there was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it.
Hark to it.â€

â€œAye, and thatâ€™s because the lid thereâ€™s a sounding-board; and
what in all things makes the sounding-board is thisâ€”thereâ€™s naught
beneath. And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same,
Carpenter. Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin
knock against the churchyard gate, going in?

â€œFaith, sir, Iâ€™veâ€”â€

â€œFaith? Whatâ€™s that?â€

â€œWhy, faith, sir, itâ€™s only a sort of exclamation-likeâ€”thatâ€™s
all, sir.â€

â€œUm, um; go on.â€

â€œI was about to say, sir, thatâ€”â€

â€œArt thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
Look at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.â€

â€œHe goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in
hot latitudes. Iâ€™ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the
Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me
some sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. Heâ€™s
always under the Lineâ€”fiery hot, I tell ye! Heâ€™s looking this
wayâ€”come, oakum; quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the
cork, and Iâ€™m the professor of musical glassesâ€”tap, tap!â€

(Ahab to himself.)

â€œThereâ€™s a sight! Thereâ€™s a sound! The grey-headed woodpecker
tapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See!
that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious
wag, that fellow. Rat-tat! So manâ€™s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial
are all materials! What things real are there, but imponderable
thoughts? Here nowâ€™s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere
hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered
life. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that
in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an
immortality-preserver! Iâ€™ll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in
the dark side of earth, that its other side, the theoretic bright one,
seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will ye never have done, Carpenter,
with that accursed sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here
when I return again. Now, then, Pip, weâ€™ll talk this over; I do suck
most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the
unknown worlds must empty into thee!â€
