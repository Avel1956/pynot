As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,
unless they previously produced their papers.

â€œWhat do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?â€ said I, now jumping on
the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.

â€œI mean,â€ he replied, â€œhe must show his papers.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head
from behind Pelegâ€™s, out of the wigwam. â€œHe must show that heâ€™s
converted. Son of darkness,â€ he added, turning to Queequeg, â€œart
thou at present in communion with any Christian church?â€

â€œWhy,â€ said I, â€œheâ€™s a member of the first Congregational
Church.â€ Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in
Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.

â€œFirst Congregational Church,â€ cried Bildad, â€œwhat! that worships
in Deacon Deuteronomy Colemanâ€™s meeting-house?â€ and so saying,
taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at
Queequeg.

â€œHow long hath he been a member?â€ he then said, turning to me;
â€œnot very long, I rather guess, young man.â€

â€œNo,â€ said Peleg, â€œand he hasnâ€™t been baptized right either, or
it would have washed some of that devilâ€™s blue off his face.â€

â€œDo tell, now,â€ cried Bildad, â€œis this Philistine a regular member
of Deacon Deuteronomyâ€™s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I
pass it every Lordâ€™s day.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,â€
said I; â€œall I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the
First Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.â€

â€œYoung man,â€ said Bildad sternly, â€œthou art skylarking with
meâ€”explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean?
answer me.â€

Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. â€œI mean, sir, the same
ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and
Queequeg here, and all of us, and every motherâ€™s son and soul of
us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole
worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some
queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in that we all join
hands.â€

â€œSplice, thou meanâ€™st splice hands,â€ cried Peleg, drawing nearer.
â€œYoung man, youâ€™d better ship for a missionary, instead of a
fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomyâ€”why
Father Mapple himself couldnâ€™t beat it, and heâ€™s reckoned something.
Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell
Quohog thereâ€”whatâ€™s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By
the great anchor, what a harpoon heâ€™s got there! looks like good stuff
that; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your
name is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever
strike a fish?â€

Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:â€”

â€œCapâ€™ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him?
well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!â€ and taking sharp aim at it,
he darted the iron right over old Bildadâ€™s broad brim, clean across
the shipâ€™s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.

â€œNow,â€ said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, â€œspos-ee him
whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.â€

â€œQuick, Bildad,â€ said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.
â€œQuick, I say, you Bildad, and get the shipâ€™s papers. We must have
Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog,
weâ€™ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and thatâ€™s more than ever was given
a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.â€

So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
enrolled among the same shipâ€™s company to which I myself belonged.

When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
signing, he turned to me and said, â€œI guess, Quohog there donâ€™t know
how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name
or make thy mark?â€

But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm;
so that through Captain Pelegâ€™s obstinate mistake touching his
appellative, it stood something like this:â€”

Quohog. his X mark.

Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one
entitled â€œThe Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,â€ placed it in
Queequegâ€™s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, â€œSon of darkness, I must do
my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for
the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,
which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial
bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the
wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear
of the fiery pit!â€

Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildadâ€™s language,
heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.

â€œAvast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our
harpooneer,â€ cried Peleg. â€œPious harpooneers never make good
voyagersâ€”it takes the shark out of â€˜em; no harpooneer is worth a
straw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the
bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the
meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy
soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of
after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.â€

â€œPeleg! Peleg!â€ said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, â€œthou
thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,
Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, canâ€™st thou
prate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell
me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that
typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain
Ahab, didâ€™st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?â€

â€œHear him, hear him now,â€ cried Peleg, marching across the cabin,
and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,â€”â€œhear him, all
of ye. Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink!
Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an
everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us,
fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think
about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of;
and how to save all handsâ€”how to rig jury-mastsâ€”how to get into the
nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.â€

Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,
where we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some
sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then
he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
otherwise might have been wasted.
