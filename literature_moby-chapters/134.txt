The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were
fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships,
cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to
carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.

Upon the strangerâ€™s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you
now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.

â€œHast seen the White Whale?â€

â€œLook!â€ replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and
with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.

â€œHast killed him?â€

â€œThe harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,â€ answered the
other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered
sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.

â€œNot forged!â€ and snatching Perthâ€™s levelled iron from the crotch,
Ahab held it out, exclaimingâ€”â€œLook ye, Nantucketer; here in this
hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are
these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind
the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!â€

â€œThen God keep thee, old manâ€”seeâ€™st thou thatâ€â€”pointing to
the hammockâ€”â€œI bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only that one I bury; the rest were
buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.â€ Then turning to
his crewâ€”â€œAre ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and
lift the body; so, thenâ€”Oh! Godâ€â€”advancing towards the hammock
with uplifted handsâ€”â€œmay the resurrection and the lifeâ€”â€

â€œBrace forward! Up helm!â€ cried Ahab like lightning to his men.

But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound
of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so
quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled
her hull with their ghostly baptism.

As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
hanging at the Pequodâ€™s stern came into conspicuous relief.

â€œHa! yonder! look yonder, men!â€ cried a foreboding voice in her
wake. â€œIn vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn
us your taffrail to show us your coffin!â€
