â€œHIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?â€

It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a
cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the
scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets
to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed
precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle
their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the
unceasingly advancing keel.

It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose
post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the
words above.

â€œHist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?â€

â€œTake the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise dâ€™ye mean?â€

â€œThere it is againâ€”under the hatchesâ€”donâ€™t you hear itâ€”a
coughâ€”it sounded like a cough.â€

â€œCough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.â€

â€œThere againâ€”there it is!â€”it sounds like two or three sleepers
turning over, now!â€

â€œCaramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? Itâ€™s the three soaked
biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of yeâ€”nothing else.
Look to the bucket!â€

â€œSay what ye will, shipmate; Iâ€™ve sharp ears.â€

â€œAye, you are the chap, ainâ€™t ye, that heard the hum of the old
Quakeressâ€™s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;
youâ€™re the chap.â€

â€œGrin away; weâ€™ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is
somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and
I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell
Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the
wind.â€

â€œTish! the bucket!â€
