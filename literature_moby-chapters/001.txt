     â€œTo fifty chosen sylphs of special note,
     We trust the important charge, the petticoat.
     Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail,
     Thoâ€™ stuffed with hoops and armed with ribs of whale.â€
      â€”Rape of the Lock.

â€œIf we compare land animals in respect to magnitude, with those
that take up their abode in the deep, we shall find they will appear
contemptible in the comparison. The whale is doubtless the largest
animal in creation.â€ â€”Goldsmith, Nat. Hist.

â€œIf you should write a fable for little fishes, you would make them
speak like great wales.â€ â€”Goldsmith to Johnson.

â€œIn the afternoon we saw what was supposed to be a rock, but it was
found to be a dead whale, which some Asiatics had killed, and were then
towing ashore. They seemed to endeavor to conceal themselves behind the
whale, in order to avoid being seen by us.â€ â€”Cookâ€™s Voyages.

â€œThe larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand in so
great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to
mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood,
and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order to
terrify and prevent their too near approach.â€ â€”Uno Von Troilâ€™s
Letters on Banksâ€™s and Solanderâ€™s Voyage to Iceland in 1772.

Burke. (somewhere.)

â€œA tenth branch of the kingâ€™s ordinary revenue, said to be grounded
on the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from
pirates and robbers, is the right to royal fish, which are whale and
sturgeon. And these, when either thrown ashore or caught near the coast,
are the property of the king.â€ â€”Blackstone.

     The ocean serves on high,
     Up-spouted by a whale in air,
     To express unwieldy joy.â€

stroke, with immense velocity.â€ â€”John Hunterâ€™s account of the
dissection of a whale. (A small sized one.)

the water-works at London Bridge, and the water roaring in its passage
through that pipe is inferior in impetus and velocity to the blood
gushing from the whaleâ€™s heart.â€ â€”Paleyâ€™s Theology.

â€œThe whale is a mammiferous animal without hind feet.â€ â€”Baron
Cuvier.

Fishery.

     â€œIn the free element beneath me swam,
     Floundered and dived, in play, in chace, in battle,
     Fishes of every colour, form, and kind;
     Which language cannot paint, and mariner
     Had never seen; from dread Leviathan
     To insect millions peopling every wave:
     Gatherâ€™d in shoals immense, like floating islands,
     Led by mysterious instincts through that waste
     And trackless region, though on every side
     Assaulted by voracious enemies,
     Whales, sharks, and monsters, armâ€™d in front or jaw,
     With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs.â€
      â€”Montgomeryâ€™s World before the Flood.

     â€œIo!  Paean!  Io! sing.
     To the finny peopleâ€™s king.

Sperm Whale in the Pacific Ocean.â€ By Owen Chace of Nantucket, first

     â€œA mariner sat in the shrouds one night,
     The wind was piping free;
     Now bright, now dimmed, was the moonlight pale,

     As it floundered in the sea.â€
      â€”Elizabeth Oakes Smith.

cracking like a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four
miles.â€ â€”Scoresby.

â€œMad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the
infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous head,
and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he rushes
at the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with vast
swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed.... It is a matter of great
astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting,
and, in a commercial point of view, so important an animal (as the Sperm
Whale) should have been so entirely neglected, or should have excited
so little curiosity among the numerous, and many of them competent
observers, that of late years, must have possessed the most abundant
and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes.â€
â€”Thomas Bealeâ€™s History of the Sperm Whale, 1839.

â€œThe Cachalotâ€ (Sperm Whale) â€œis not only better armed than the
True Whaleâ€ (Greenland or Right Whale) â€œin possessing a formidable
weapon at either extremity of its body, but also more frequently
displays a disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in
manner at once so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being
regarded as the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the
whale tribe.â€ â€”Frederick Debell Bennettâ€™s Whaling Voyage Round the
Globe, 1840.

      â€œMast-head ahoy!  Do you see that whale now?â€
      â€œAy ay, sir!  A shoal of Sperm Whales!  There she blows!  There she
     breaches!â€
      â€œSing out! sing out every time!â€

to have indirectly hit upon new clews to that same mystic North-West
Passage.â€ â€”From â€œSomethingâ€ unpublished.

â€œIt is impossible to meet a whale-ship on the ocean without being
struck by her near appearance. The vessel under short sail, with
