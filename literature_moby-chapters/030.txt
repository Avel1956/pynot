Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now
went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic.
The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days,
were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped upâ€”flaked up, with
rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their
absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man,
â€˜twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing
nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely
lend new spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned
upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on;
then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless
twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on
Ahabâ€™s texture.

Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,
the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he
seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. â€œIt
feels like going down into oneâ€™s tomb,â€â€”he would mutter to
himselfâ€”â€œfor an old captain like me to be descending this narrow
scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.â€

So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;
and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt
it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when
this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the
silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man
would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way.
Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these,
he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his
wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such
would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that
their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once,
the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy,
lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast,
Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a certain
unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was
pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but there might
be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something indistinctly and
hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the
ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab then.

â€œAm I a cannon-ball, Stubb,â€ said Ahab, â€œthat thou wouldst wad me
that fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;
where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at
last.â€”Down, dog, and kennel!â€

Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
â€œI am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half
like it, sir.â€

â€œAvast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,
as if to avoid some passionate temptation.

â€œNo, sir; not yet,â€ said Stubb, emboldened, â€œI will not tamely be
called a dog, sir.â€

â€œThen be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and
begone, or Iâ€™ll clear the world of thee!â€

As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in
his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.

â€œI was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,â€
muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.
â€œItâ€™s very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I donâ€™t well know
whether to go back and strike him, orâ€”whatâ€™s that?â€”down here on my
knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but
it would be the first time I ever did pray. Itâ€™s queer; very queer;
and heâ€™s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, heâ€™s about the
queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!â€”his
eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway thereâ€™s something on his
mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.
He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the
twenty-four; and he donâ€™t sleep then. Didnâ€™t that Dough-Boy, the
steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old manâ€™s
hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the
foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of
frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I
guess heâ€™s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; itâ€™s a kind
of Tic-Dolly-row they sayâ€”worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I donâ€™t
know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. Heâ€™s full of
riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night,
as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; whatâ€™s that for, I should like
to know? Whoâ€™s made appointments with him in the hold? Ainâ€™t that
queer, now? But thereâ€™s no telling, itâ€™s the old gameâ€”Here goes
for a snooze. Damn me, itâ€™s worth a fellowâ€™s while to be born into
the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it,
thatâ€™s about the first thing babies do, and thatâ€™s a sort of queer,
too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of â€˜em. But
thatâ€™s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment;
and sleep when you can, is my twelfthâ€”So here goes again. But howâ€™s
that? didnâ€™t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a
donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that! He might as well
have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me, and I didnâ€™t
observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed
like a bleached bone. What the devilâ€™s the matter with me? I donâ€™t
stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of
turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,
thoughâ€”How? how? how?â€”but the only wayâ€™s to stash it; so here
goes to hammock again; and in the morning, Iâ€™ll see how this plaguey
juggling thinks over by daylight.â€
