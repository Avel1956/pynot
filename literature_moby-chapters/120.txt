The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These
last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one
could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay
by its side all night; and that boat was Ahabâ€™s.

The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whaleâ€™s spout-hole; and
the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare
upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which
gently chafed the whaleâ€™s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.

Ahab and all his boatâ€™s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who
crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played
round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails.
A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.

Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and
hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
flooded world. â€œI have dreamed it again,â€ said he.

â€œOf the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
coffin can be thine?â€

â€œAnd who are hearsed that die on the sea?â€

â€œBut I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
America.â€

â€œAye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:â€”a hearse and its plumes
floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
sight we shall not soon see.â€

â€œBelieve it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.â€

â€œAnd what was that saying about thyself?â€

â€œThough it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy
pilot.â€

â€œAnd when thou art so gone beforeâ€”if that ever befallâ€”then ere I
can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?â€”Was it
not so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here
two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.â€

â€œTake another pledge, old man,â€ said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted
up like fire-flies in the gloomâ€”â€œHemp only can kill thee.â€

â€œThe gallows, ye mean.â€”I am immortal then, on land and on sea,â€
cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;â€”â€œImmortal on land and on
sea!â€

Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
slumbering crew arose from the boatâ€™s bottom, and ere noon the dead
whale was brought to the ship.
