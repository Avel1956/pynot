While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance
upon other means of determining the vesselâ€™s place, some merchantmen,
and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the
log; though at the same time, and frequently more for formâ€™s sake
than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate
the course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate
of progression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden
reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the
railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and
wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
hung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he
happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene,
and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic
oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing plungingly;
astern the billows rolled in riots.

â€œForward, there! Heave the log!â€

Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
â€œTake the reel, one of ye, Iâ€™ll heave.â€

They went towards the extreme stern, on the shipâ€™s lee side, where the
deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into
the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.

The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.

Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
speak.

â€œSir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
spoiled it.â€

â€œâ€˜Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled
thee? Thou seemâ€™st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not
thou it.â€

â€œI hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey
hairs of mine â€˜tis not worth while disputing, â€˜specially with a
superior, whoâ€™ll neâ€™er confess.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s that? There nowâ€™s a patched professor in Queen Natureâ€™s
granite-founded College; but methinks heâ€™s too subservient. Where wert
thou born?â€

â€œIn the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.â€

â€œExcellent! Thouâ€™st hit the world by that.â€

â€œI know not, sir, but I was born there.â€

â€œIn the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, itâ€™s good. Hereâ€™s
a man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned
of Man; which is sucked inâ€”by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind
wall butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.â€

The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In
turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.

â€œHold hard!â€

Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging
log was gone.

â€œI crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;
reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and
mend thou the line. See to it.â€

â€œThere he goes now; to him nothingâ€™s happened; but to me, the
skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,
Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and
dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?â€

â€œPip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pipâ€™s
missing. Letâ€™s see now if ye havenâ€™t fished him up here, fisherman.
It drags hard; I guess heâ€™s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him
off; we haul in no cowards here. Ho! thereâ€™s his arm just breaking
water. A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it offâ€”we haul in no cowards here.
Captain Ahab! sir, sir! hereâ€™s Pip, trying to get on board again.â€

â€œPeace, thou crazy loon,â€ cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
â€œAway from the quarter-deck!â€

â€œThe greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,â€ muttered Ahab,
advancing. â€œHands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was,
boy?

â€œAstern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!â€

â€œAnd who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils
of thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to
sieve through! Who art thou, boy?â€

â€œBell-boy, sir; shipâ€™s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip!
One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet highâ€”looks
cowardlyâ€”quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Whoâ€™s seen Pip
the coward?â€

â€œThere can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens!
look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned
him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahabâ€™s cabin shall be Pipâ€™s
home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy;
thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, letâ€™s
down.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s this? hereâ€™s velvet shark-skin,â€ intently gazing at
Ahabâ€™s hand, and feeling it. â€œAh, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind
a thing as this, perhaps he had neâ€™er been lost! This seems to me,
sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let
old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one
with the white, for I will not let this go.â€

â€œOh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in
gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not
what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come!
I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an
Emperorâ€™s!â€

â€œThere go two daft ones now,â€ muttered the old Manxman. â€œOne daft
with strength, the other daft with weakness. But hereâ€™s the end of the
rotten lineâ€”all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a
new line altogether. Iâ€™ll see Mr. Stubb about it.â€
