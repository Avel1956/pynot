The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.

â€œDâ€™ye see him?â€ cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.

â€œIn his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, thatâ€™s all.
Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely
day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to
the angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a
fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Hereâ€™s food for thought,
had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels,
feels; thatâ€™s tingling enough for mortal man! to thinkâ€™s audacity.
God only has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a
coolness and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains
beat too much for that. And yet, Iâ€™ve sometimes thought my brain was
very calmâ€”frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in
which the contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is
growing now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, itâ€™s
like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the
earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds
blow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash
the tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere
this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and
ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.
Out upon it!â€”itâ€™s tainted. Were I the wind, Iâ€™d blow no more on
such a wicked, miserable world. Iâ€™d crawl somewhere to a cave, and
slink there. And yet, â€˜tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who
ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.
Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that
strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.
Even Ahab is a braver thingâ€”a nobler thing than that. Would now the
wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage
mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects,
not as agents. Thereâ€™s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most
malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that
thereâ€™s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm
Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in
strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,
however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest
Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go
at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly
blow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like themâ€”something
so unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it!
Aloft there! What dâ€™ye see?â€

â€œNothing, sir.â€

â€œNothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!
Aye, aye, it must be so. Iâ€™ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,
heâ€™s chasing me now; not I, himâ€”thatâ€™s bad; I might have known it,
too. Fool! the linesâ€”the harpoons heâ€™s towing. Aye, aye, I have run
him by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular
look outs! Man the braces!â€

Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequodâ€™s
quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced
ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
white wake.

â€œAgainst the wind he now steers for the open jaw,â€ murmured Starbuck
to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. â€œGod
keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside
wet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!â€

â€œStand by to sway me up!â€ cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen
basket. â€œWe should meet him soon.â€

â€œAye, aye, sir,â€ and straightway Starbuck did Ahabâ€™s bidding, and
once more Ahab swung on high.

A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three
mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced
it.

â€œForehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
there!â€”brace sharper up; crowd her into the windâ€™s eye. Heâ€™s too
far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that
helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But
let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; thereâ€™s
time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and
not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of
Nantucket! The same!â€”the same!â€”the same to Noah as to me. Thereâ€™s
a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead
somewhereâ€”to something else than common land, more palmy than the
palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward,
then; the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old
mast-head! Whatâ€™s this?â€”green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped
cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahabâ€™s head! Thereâ€™s the
difference now between manâ€™s old age and matterâ€™s. But aye, old
mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not,
my ship? Aye, minus a leg, thatâ€™s all. By heaven this dead wood has
the better of my live flesh every way. I canâ€™t compare with it; and
Iâ€™ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men
made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers. Whatâ€™s that he said?
he should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But
where? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend
those endless stairs? and all night Iâ€™ve been sailing from him,
wherever he did sink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou toldâ€™st direful
truth as touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell
short. Good-bye, mast-headâ€”keep a good eye upon the whale, the while
Iâ€™m gone. Weâ€™ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale
lies down there, tied by head and tail.â€

He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
through the cloven blue air to the deck.

In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallopâ€™s
stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
mate,â€”who held one of the tackle-ropes on deckâ€”and bade him pause.

â€œStarbuck!â€

â€œSir?â€

â€œFor the third time my soulâ€™s ship starts upon this voyage,
Starbuck.â€

â€œAye, sir, thou wilt have it so.â€

â€œSome ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
Starbuck!â€

â€œTruth, sir: saddest truth.â€

â€œSome men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
flood;â€”and I feel now like a billow thatâ€™s all one crested comb,
Starbuck. I am old;â€”shake hands with me, man.â€

Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuckâ€™s tears the glue.

â€œOh, my captain, my captain!â€”noble heartâ€”go notâ€”go not!â€”see,
itâ€™s a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion
then!â€

â€œLower away!â€â€”cried Ahab, tossing the mateâ€™s arm from him.
â€œStand by the crew!â€

In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.

â€œThe sharks! the sharks!â€ cried a voice from the low cabin-window
there; â€œO master, my master, come back!â€

But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
boat leaped on.

Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they
dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their
bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in
those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in
the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching
regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been
observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried;
and whether it was that Ahabâ€™s crew were all such tiger-yellow
barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the
sharksâ€”a matter sometimes well known to affect them,â€”however it was,
they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.

â€œHeart of wrought steel!â€ murmured Starbuck gazing over the side,
and following with his eyes the receding boatâ€”â€œcanst thou yet ring
boldly to that sight?â€”lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and
followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical
third day?â€”For when three days flow together in one continuous intense
pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the
third the evening and the end of that thingâ€”be that end what it may.
Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly
calm, yet expectant,â€”fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim
before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow
grown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I
seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life
seem clearing; but clouds sweep betweenâ€”Is my journeyâ€™s end coming?
My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy
heart,â€”beats it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!â€”stave it offâ€”move,
move! speak aloud!â€”Mast-head there! See ye my boyâ€™s hand on the
hill?â€”Crazed;â€”aloft there!â€”keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:â€”

â€œMark well the whale!â€”Ho! again!â€”drive off that hawk! see! he
pecksâ€”he tears the vaneâ€â€”pointing to the red flag flying at the
main-truckâ€”â€œHa! he soars away with it!â€”Whereâ€™s the old man now?
seeâ€™st thou that sight, oh Ahab!â€”shudder, shudder!â€

The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the
mast-headsâ€”a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had
sounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his
way a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining
the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered
against the opposing bow.

â€œDrive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no
hearse can be mine:â€”and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!â€

Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of
ice, swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it
hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back
into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for
an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of
flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the
marble trunk of the whale.

â€œGive way!â€ cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward
to the attack; but maddened by yesterdayâ€™s fresh irons that corroded
in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that
fell from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his
broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted
together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and
once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the
two matesâ€™ boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their
bows, but leaving Ahabâ€™s almost without a scar.

While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and
round to the fishâ€™s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,
during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines
around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment
frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.

The harpoon dropped from his hand.

â€œBefooled, befooled!â€â€”drawing in a long lean breathâ€”â€œAye,
Parsee! I see thee again.â€”Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this
then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last
letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the
ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and
return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to dieâ€”Down, men! the first thing
that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I
harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey
me.â€”Whereâ€™s the whale? gone down again?â€

But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had
been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily
swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,â€”which thus far had
been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present
her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost
velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the
sea.

â€œOh! Ahab,â€ cried Starbuck, â€œnot too late is it, even now, the
third day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou,
that madly seekest him!â€

Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by
the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuckâ€™s face as he
leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow
him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he
saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three
mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats
which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in
repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he sped,
he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves
on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he
heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving
a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or
flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had
just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer
and nails, and so nail it to the mast.

Whether fagged by the three daysâ€™ running chase, and the resistance
to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
Whaleâ€™s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly
nearing him once more; though indeed the whaleâ€™s last start had not
been so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves
the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the
boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became
jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost
every dip.

â€œHeed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.
Pull on! â€˜tis the better rest, the sharkâ€™s jaw than the yielding
water.â€

â€œBut at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!â€

â€œThey will last long enough! pull on!â€”But who can tellâ€â€”he
mutteredâ€”â€œwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
Ahab?â€”But pull on! Aye, all alive, nowâ€”we near him. The helm! take
the helm! let me pass,â€â€”and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him
forward to the bows of the still flying boat.

At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along
with the White Whaleâ€™s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
advanceâ€”as the whale sometimes willâ€”and Ahab was fairly within the
smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whaleâ€™s spout, curled
round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked
into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh
flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly
canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the
gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed
into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmenâ€”who foreknew not the
precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its
effectsâ€”these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of
them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing
wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly
dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.

Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their
seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line
felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!

â€œWhat breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!â€”â€˜tis whole again; oars!
oars! Burst in upon him!â€

Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing
in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking itâ€”it may beâ€”a
larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. â€œI grow blind; hands!
stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Isâ€™t night?â€

â€œThe whale! The ship!â€ cried the cringing oarsmen.

â€œOars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for
ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see:
the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?â€

But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat
lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying
hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.

Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtegoâ€™s mast-head hammer
remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon
as he.

â€œThe whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers
of air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a
womanâ€™s fainting fit. Up helm, I sayâ€”ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is
this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?
Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up
helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on
towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me
now!â€

â€œStand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now
help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning
whale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubbâ€™s own
unwinking eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is
all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou
grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of
as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet
ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou
grinning whale, but thereâ€™ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye
not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in
his drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;â€”cherries!
cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!â€

â€œCherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope
my poor motherâ€™s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will
now come to her, for the voyage is up.â€

From the shipâ€™s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive;
hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in
their hands, just as they had darted from their various employments;
all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to
side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of
overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,
swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of
all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead
smote the shipâ€™s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some
fell flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the
harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach,
they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.

â€œThe ship! The hearse!â€”the second hearse!â€ cried Ahab from the
boat; â€œits wood could only be American!â€

Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahabâ€™s boat, where, for a
time, he lay quiescent.

â€œI turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy
hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked
keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm,
and Pole-pointed prow,â€”death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and
without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked
captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel my topmost
greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your furthest
bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life,
and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou
all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee;
from hellâ€™s heart I stab at thee; for hateâ€™s sake I spit my last
breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up
the spear!â€

The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
velocity the line ran through the grooves;â€”ran foul. Ahab stooped
to clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the
neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the
heavy eye-splice in the ropeâ€™s final end flew out of the stark-empty
tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
depths.

For an instant, the tranced boatâ€™s crew stood still; then turned.
â€œThe ship? Great God, where is the ship?â€ Soon they through dim,
bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous
Fata Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by
infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the
pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.
And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its
crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate
and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest
chip of the Pequod out of sight.

But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying
billows they almost touched;â€”at that instant, a red arm and a hammer
hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing
the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that
tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;
this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the
hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill,
the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen
there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his
imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the
flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink
to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and
helmeted herself with it.

Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white
surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great
shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.





Epilogue â€œAND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEEâ€ Job.

The dramaâ€™s done. Why then here does any one step forth?â€”Because one
did survive the wreck.

It so chanced, that after the Parseeâ€™s disappearance, I was he whom
the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahabâ€™s bowsman, when that
bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the
three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern.
So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of
it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then,
but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had
subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting
towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling
circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital
centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of
its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great
force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and
floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day
and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks,
they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks
sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer,
and picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in
her retracing search after her missing children, only found another
orphan.
