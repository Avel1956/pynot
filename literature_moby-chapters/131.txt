Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the
time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from
the smitten hull.

â€œBad news; she brings bad news,â€ muttered the old Manxman. But ere
her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he
could hopefully hail, Ahabâ€™s voice was heard.

â€œHast seen the White Whale?â€

â€œAye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?â€

Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;
and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain
himself, having stopped his vesselâ€™s way, was seen descending her
side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequodâ€™s
main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was recognised by
Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.

â€œWhere was he?â€”not killed!â€”not killed!â€ cried Ahab, closely
advancing. â€œHow was it?â€

It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while
three of the strangerâ€™s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales,
which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they
were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby
Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward;
whereupon, the fourth rigged boatâ€”a reserved oneâ€”had been instantly
lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth
boatâ€”the swiftest keeled of allâ€”seemed to have succeeded in
fasteningâ€”at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell
anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;
and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing
more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have
indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was
some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals
were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her
three far to windward boatsâ€”ere going in quest of the fourth one
in the precisely opposite directionâ€”the ship had not only been
necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but,
for the time, to increase her distance from it. But the rest of her
crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sailâ€”stunsail on
stunsailâ€”after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for
a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she
had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the
absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare
boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again
dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus
continued doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing
keel had been seen.

The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his
object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his
own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.

â€œI will wager something now,â€ whispered Stubb to Flask, â€œthat some
one in that missing boat wore off that Captainâ€™s best coat; mayhap,
his watchâ€”heâ€™s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard
of two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in
the height of the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he
looksâ€”pale in the very buttons of his eyesâ€”lookâ€”it wasnâ€™t the
coatâ€”it must have been theâ€”â€

â€œMy boy, my own boy is among them. For Godâ€™s sakeâ€”I beg, I
conjureâ€â€”here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far
had but icily received his petition. â€œFor eight-and-forty hours let
me charter your shipâ€”I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for
itâ€”if there be no other wayâ€”for eight-and-forty hours onlyâ€”only
thatâ€”you must, oh, you must, and you shall do this thing.â€

â€œHis son!â€ cried Stubb, â€œoh, itâ€™s his son heâ€™s lost! I take
back the coat and watchâ€”what says Ahab? We must save that boy.â€

â€œHeâ€™s drowned with the rest on â€˜em, last night,â€ said the old
Manx sailor standing behind them; â€œI heard; all of ye heard their
spirits.â€

Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachelâ€™s
the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of
the Captainâ€™s sons among the number of the missing boatâ€™s crew; but
among the number of the other boatâ€™s crews, at the same time, but on
the other hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes
of the chase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the
wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;
which was only solved for him by his chief mateâ€™s instinctively
adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,
that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always
to pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown
constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and
not till forced to it by Ahabâ€™s iciness did he allude to his one yet
missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the
earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketerâ€™s paternal love,
had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a
vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it
unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such
tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four yearsâ€™
voyage in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge
of a whalemanâ€™s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of
a fatherâ€™s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness
and concern.

Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;
and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
the least quivering of his own.

â€œI will not go,â€ said the stranger, â€œtill you say aye to me. Do to
me as you would have me do to you in the like case. For you too have
a boy, Captain Ahabâ€”though but a child, and nestling safely at
home nowâ€”a child of your old age tooâ€”Yes, yes, you relent; I see
itâ€”run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.â€

â€œAvast,â€ cried Ahabâ€”â€œtouch not a rope-yarnâ€; then in a voice
that prolongingly moulded every wordâ€”â€œCaptain Gardiner, I will not
do it. Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and
may I forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle
watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all
strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.â€

Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter
rejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,
Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his
boat, and returned to his ship.

Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round;
starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a
head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, her
masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry
trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.

But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw
that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort.
She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.
