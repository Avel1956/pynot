Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but
in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
eyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the
binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass,
that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his
purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast,
then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin
there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed
with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.

But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some
certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little
worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by
the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in
the Milky Way.

Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the
heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the
head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all
the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,
untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito
glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed
by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick
darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every
sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was
set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton
in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white
whaleâ€™s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by
night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever
live to spend it.

Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun
and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sunâ€™s
disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,
are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems
almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing
through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.

It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example
of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL
ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the
middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it;
and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that
knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three
Andesâ€™ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a
crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned
zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the
keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra.

Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
pausing.

â€œThereâ€™s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
all other grand and lofty things; look here,â€”three peaks as proud as
Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all
are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
which, like a magicianâ€™s glass, to each and every man in turn but
mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those
who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now
this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign
of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a
former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in
throes, â€˜tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be
it, then! Hereâ€™s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.â€

â€œNo fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devilâ€™s claws must
have left their mouldings there since yesterday,â€ murmured Starbuck
to himself, leaning against the bulwarks. â€œThe old man seems to read
Belshazzarâ€™s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly.
He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty,
heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint
earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over
all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a
hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;
but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer.
Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain
snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin
speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it,
lest Truth shake me falsely.â€

â€œThere nowâ€™s the old Mogul,â€ soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,
â€œheâ€™s been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same,
and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine
fathoms long. And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have
it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaerâ€™s Hook, Iâ€™d not look at it very
long ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard
this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your
doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili,
your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of
gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes.
What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so
killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! hereâ€™s
signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome
calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. Iâ€™ll get
the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Dabollâ€™s
arithmetic, Iâ€™ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer
curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Hereâ€™s the book.
Letâ€™s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, heâ€™s always among
â€˜em. Hem, hem, hem; here they areâ€”here they goâ€”all alive:â€”Aries,
or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! hereâ€™s Gemini himself, or
the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among â€˜em. Aye, here on the coin
heâ€™s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms
all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know
your places. Youâ€™ll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we
come in to supply the thoughts. Thatâ€™s my small experience, so far as
the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditchâ€™s navigator, and Dabollâ€™s
arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful
in signs, and significant in wonders! Thereâ€™s a clue somewhere; wait
a bit; histâ€”hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac
here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now Iâ€™ll read it
off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin: thereâ€™s
Aries, or the Ramâ€”lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the
Bullâ€”he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twinsâ€”that is,
Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab,
and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion,
lies in the pathâ€”he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his
paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! thatâ€™s our first love;
we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the
Scalesâ€”happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad
about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion,
stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come the
arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As
we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! hereâ€™s the battering-ram,
Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong
we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole
deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we
sleep. Thereâ€™s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes
through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty.
Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow
here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jollyâ€™s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon!
But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now,
and letâ€™s hear what heâ€™ll have to say. There; heâ€™s before it;
heâ€™ll out with something presently. So, so; heâ€™s beginning.â€

â€œI see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever
raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, whatâ€™s
all this staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, thatâ€™s true;
and at two cents the cigar, thatâ€™s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I
wonâ€™t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and hereâ€™s
nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy â€˜em
out.â€

â€œShall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort
of wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxmanâ€”the old
hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He
luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side
of the mast; why, thereâ€™s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now
heâ€™s back again; what does that mean? Hark! heâ€™s mutteringâ€”voice
like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!â€

â€œIf the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
the sun stands in some one of these signs. Iâ€™ve studied signs, and
know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the
old witch in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The
horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And whatâ€™s
the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe signâ€”the roaring and
devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.â€

â€œThereâ€™s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men
in one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequegâ€”all
tattooingâ€”looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the
Cannibal? As I live heâ€™s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels,
I suppose, as the old women talk Surgeonâ€™s Astronomy in the back
country. And by Jove, heâ€™s found something there in the vicinity of
his thighâ€”I guess itâ€™s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he donâ€™t
know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off
some kingâ€™s trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,
Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his
pumps as usual. What does he say, with that look of his? Ah, only makes
a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coinâ€”fire
worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pipâ€”poor
boy! would he had died, or I; heâ€™s half horrible to me. He too has
been watching all of these interpretersâ€”myself includedâ€”and look
now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot face. Stand away again
and hear him. Hark!â€

â€œI look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.â€

â€œUpon my soul, heâ€™s been studying Murrayâ€™s Grammar! Improving his
mind, poor fellow! But whatâ€™s that he says nowâ€”hist!â€

â€œI look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.â€

â€œWhy, heâ€™s getting it by heartâ€”hist! again.â€

â€œI look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s funny.â€

â€œAnd I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and Iâ€™m a
crow, especially when I stand aâ€™top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw!
caw! caw! caw! caw! Ainâ€™t I a crow? And whereâ€™s the scare-crow?
There he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two
more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.â€

â€œWonder if he means me?â€”complimentary!â€”poor lad!â€”I could go hang
myself. Any way, for the present, Iâ€™ll quit Pipâ€™s vicinity. I can
stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but heâ€™s too crazy-witty for
my sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.â€

â€œHereâ€™s the shipâ€™s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all
on fire to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and whatâ€™s the
consequence? Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when
aughtâ€™s nailed to the mast itâ€™s a sign that things grow desperate.
Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; heâ€™ll nail ye! This is a pine tree.
My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a
silver ring grown over in it; some old darkeyâ€™s wedding ring. How did
it get there? And so theyâ€™ll say in the resurrection, when they come
to fish up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded
oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold!
the green miserâ€™ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes â€˜mong the
worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!â€
