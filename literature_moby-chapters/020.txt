â€œShipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?â€

Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from
the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when
the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but
shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a
black handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed
bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.

â€œHave ye shipped in her?â€ he repeated.

â€œYou mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,â€ said I, trying to gain a
little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.

â€œAye, the Pequodâ€”that ship there,â€ he said, drawing back his whole
arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.

â€œYes,â€ said I, â€œwe have just signed the articles.â€

â€œAnything down there about your souls?â€

â€œAbout what?â€

â€œOh, perhaps you havâ€™nâ€™t got any,â€ he said quickly. â€œNo matter
though, I know many chaps that havâ€™nâ€™t got any,â€”good luck to
â€˜em; and they are all the better off for it. A soulâ€™s a sort of a
fifth wheel to a wagon.â€

â€œWhat are you jabbering about, shipmate?â€ said I.

â€œHeâ€™s got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that
sort in other chaps,â€ abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous
emphasis upon the word he.

â€œQueequeg,â€ said I, â€œletâ€™s go; this fellow has broken loose
from somewhere; heâ€™s talking about something and somebody we donâ€™t
know.â€

â€œStop!â€ cried the stranger. â€œYe said trueâ€”ye havâ€™nâ€™t seen
Old Thunder yet, have ye?â€

â€œWhoâ€™s Old Thunder?â€ said I, again riveted with the insane
earnestness of his manner.

â€œCaptain Ahab.â€

â€œWhat! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?â€

â€œAye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye
havâ€™nâ€™t seen him yet, have ye?â€

â€œNo, we havâ€™nâ€™t. Heâ€™s sick they say, but is getting better, and
will be all right again before long.â€

â€œAll right again before long!â€ laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
derisive sort of laugh. â€œLook ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.â€

â€œWhat do you know about him?â€

â€œWhat did they tell you about him? Say that!â€

â€œThey didnâ€™t tell much of anything about him; only Iâ€™ve heard that
heâ€™s a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.â€

â€œThatâ€™s true, thatâ€™s trueâ€”yes, both true enough. But you must
jump when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and goâ€”thatâ€™s the
word with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to
him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and
nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the
altar in Santa?â€”heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver
calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,
according to the prophecy. Didnâ€™t ye hear a word about them matters
and something more, eh? No, I donâ€™t think ye did; how could ye? Who
knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But howsâ€™ever, mayhap, yeâ€™ve
heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of
that, I dare say. Oh yes, that every one knows aâ€™mostâ€”I mean they
know heâ€™s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.â€

â€œMy friend,â€ said I, â€œwhat all this gibberish of yours is about, I
donâ€™t know, and I donâ€™t much care; for it seems to me that you must
be a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain
Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know
all about the loss of his leg.â€

â€œAll about it, ehâ€”sure you do?â€”all?â€

â€œPretty sure.â€

With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
little, turned and said:â€”â€œYeâ€™ve shipped, have ye? Names down on
the papers? Well, well, whatâ€™s signed, is signed; and whatâ€™s to
be, will be; and then again, perhaps it wonâ€™t be, after all. Anyhow,
itâ€™s all fixed and arranged aâ€™ready; and some sailors or other must
go with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity â€˜em!
Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; Iâ€™m
sorry I stopped ye.â€

â€œLook here, friend,â€ said I, â€œif you have anything important to
tell us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you
are mistaken in your game; thatâ€™s all I have to say.â€

â€œAnd itâ€™s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that
way; you are just the man for himâ€”the likes of ye. Morning to ye,
shipmates, morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell â€˜em Iâ€™ve concluded
not to make one of â€˜em.â€

â€œAh, my dear fellow, you canâ€™t fool us that wayâ€”you canâ€™t fool
us. It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had
a great secret in him.â€

â€œMorning to ye, shipmates, morning.â€

â€œMorning it is,â€ said I. â€œCome along, Queequeg, letâ€™s leave this
crazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?â€

â€œElijah.â€

Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
otherâ€™s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he
was nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone
perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I
said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging
us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This
circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,
shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain
Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver
calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship
the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage
we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.

I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,
and on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without
seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it
seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.
