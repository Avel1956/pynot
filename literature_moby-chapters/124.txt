Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over
the anchors there hanging.

â€œNo, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but
you will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long
ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didnâ€™t you once say that
whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its
insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft
and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didnâ€™t you say so?â€

â€œWell, suppose I did? What then? Iâ€™ve part changed my flesh since
that time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we are loaded with powder
barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty
red hair, but you couldnâ€™t get afire now. Shake yourself; youâ€™re
Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat
collar. Donâ€™t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine
Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But
hark, again, and Iâ€™ll answer ye the other thing. First take your leg
off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope;
now listen. Whatâ€™s the mighty difference between holding a mastâ€™s
lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that
hasnâ€™t got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Donâ€™t you see, you
timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the
mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in
a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,â€”aye, man, and all of us,â€”were
in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten
thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I
suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small
lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia
officerâ€™s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why
donâ€™t ye be sensible, Flask? itâ€™s easy to be sensible; why donâ€™t
ye, then? any man with half an eye can be sensible.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.â€

â€œYes, when a fellowâ€™s soaked through, itâ€™s hard to be sensible,
thatâ€™s a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind;
catch the turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these
anchors now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these
two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a manâ€™s hands behind him.
And what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron
fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the
world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long
cable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and weâ€™ve done. So; next
to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just
wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs
so, Flask; but seems to me, a Long tailed coat ought always to be worn
in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to
carry off the water, dâ€™ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form
gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for
me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so. Halloa!
whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that
come from heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a nasty night, lad.â€
