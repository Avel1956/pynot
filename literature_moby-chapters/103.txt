Enderby, of London.

â€œShip, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?â€

So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing
down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his
hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger
captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boatâ€™s bow. He was
a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or
thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in
festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed
behind him like the broidered arm of a hussarâ€™s surcoat.

â€œHast seen the White Whale!â€

â€œSee you this?â€ and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden
it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden
head like a mallet.

â€œMan my boat!â€ cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars
near himâ€”â€œStand by to lower!â€

In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger.
But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the
moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never
once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was
always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other
vessel at a momentâ€™s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter
for anybodyâ€”except those who are almost hourly used to it, like
whalemenâ€”to clamber up a shipâ€™s side from a boat on the open sea;
for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and
then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived
of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied
with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a
clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height
he could hardly hope to attain.

It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And
in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the
two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a
pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem
to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to
use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,
because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
cried out, â€œI see, I see!â€”avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing
over the cutting-tackle.â€

As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved
blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This
was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his
solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the
fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the
word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his
own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of
the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and
gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust
forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his
ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades)
cried out in his walrus way, â€œAye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones
together!â€”an arm and a leg!â€”an arm that never can shrink, dâ€™ye
see; and a leg that never can run. Where didâ€™st thou see the White
Whale?â€”how long ago?â€

â€œThe White Whale,â€ said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm
towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been
a telescope; â€œthere I saw him, on the Line, last season.â€

â€œAnd he took that arm off, did he?â€ asked Ahab, now sliding down
from the capstan, and resting on the Englishmanâ€™s shoulder, as he did
so.

â€œAye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?â€

â€œSpin me the yarn,â€ said Ahab; â€œhow was it?â€

â€œIt was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,â€
began the Englishman. â€œI was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.
Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat
fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went
milling and milling round so, that my boatâ€™s crew could only trim
dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up
breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a
milky-white head and hump, all crowsâ€™ feet and wrinkles.â€

â€œIt was he, it was he!â€ cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his
suspended breath.

â€œAnd harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.â€

â€œAye, ayeâ€”they were mineâ€”my irons,â€ cried Ahab,
exultinglyâ€”â€œbut on!â€

â€œGive me a chance, then,â€ said the Englishman, good-humoredly.
â€œWell, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs
all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!

â€œAye, I see!â€”wanted to part it; free the fast-fishâ€”an old
trickâ€”I know him.â€

â€œHow it was exactly,â€ continued the one-armed commander, â€œI do
not know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there
somehow; but we didnâ€™t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled
on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other
whaleâ€™s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters
stood, and what a noble great whale it wasâ€”the noblest and biggest
I ever saw, sir, in my lifeâ€”I resolved to capture him, spite of the
boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would
get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil
of a boatâ€™s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say,
I jumped into my first mateâ€™s boatâ€”Mr. Mounttopâ€™s here (by the
way, Captainâ€”Mounttop; Mounttopâ€”the captain);â€”as I was saying,
I jumped into Mounttopâ€™s boat, which, dâ€™ye see, was gunwale and
gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old
great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sirâ€”hearts and souls
alive, manâ€”the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a batâ€”both
eyes outâ€”all befogged and bedeadened with black foamâ€”the whaleâ€™s
tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like
a marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at
midday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say,
after the second iron, to toss it overboardâ€”down comes the tail like a
Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,
flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was
all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized
hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that
like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same
instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a
flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me
caught me hereâ€ (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); â€œyes,
caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hellâ€™s flames, I was
thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript
its way along the fleshâ€”clear along the whole length of my armâ€”came
out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;â€”and that gentleman there will
tell you the rest (by the way, captainâ€”Dr. Bunger, shipâ€™s surgeon:
Bunger, my lad,â€”the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the
yarn.â€

The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the
time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his
gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober
one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched
trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a
marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
crippled captains. But, at his superiorâ€™s introduction of him to
Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captainâ€™s
bidding.

â€œIt was a shocking bad wound,â€ began the whale-surgeon; â€œand,
taking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammyâ€”â€

â€œSamuel Enderby is the name of my ship,â€ interrupted the one-armed
captain, addressing Ahab; â€œgo on, boy.â€

â€œStood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing
hot weather there on the Line. But it was no useâ€”I did all I could;
sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of
dietâ€”â€

â€œOh, very severe!â€ chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly
altering his voice, â€œDrinking hot rum toddies with me every night,
till he couldnâ€™t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed,
half seas over, about three oâ€™clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars!
he sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great
watcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog,
laugh out! why donâ€™t ye? You know youâ€™re a precious jolly rascal.)
But, heave ahead, boy, Iâ€™d rather be killed by you than kept alive by
any other man.â€

â€œMy captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sirâ€â€”said
the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahabâ€”â€œis
apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that
sort. But I may as well sayâ€”en passant, as the French remarkâ€”that I
myselfâ€”that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergyâ€”am a
strict total abstinence man; I never drinkâ€”â€

â€œWater!â€ cried the captain; â€œhe never drinks it; itâ€™s a sort of
fits to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go onâ€”go
on with the arm story.â€

â€œYes, I may as well,â€ said the surgeon, coolly. â€œI was about
observing, sir, before Captain Boomerâ€™s facetious interruption, that
spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse
and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon
ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with
the lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and
off it came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there;
that thing is against all ruleâ€â€”pointing at it with the
marlingspikeâ€”â€œthat is the captainâ€™s work, not mine; he ordered the
carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to
knock some oneâ€™s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once.
He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent,
sirâ€â€”removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a
bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry
trace, or any token of ever having been a woundâ€”â€œWell, the captain
there will tell you how that came here; he knows.â€

â€œNo, I donâ€™t,â€ said the captain, â€œbut his mother did; he was
born with it. Oh, you solemn rogue, youâ€”you Bunger! was there ever
such another Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought
to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you
rascal.â€

â€œWhat became of the White Whale?â€ now cried Ahab, who thus far had
been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.

â€œOh!â€ cried the one-armed captain, â€œoh, yes! Well; after he
sounded, we didnâ€™t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before
hinted, I didnâ€™t then know what whale it was that had served me such a
trick, till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard
about Moby Dickâ€”as some call himâ€”and then I knew it was he.â€

â€œDidâ€™st thou cross his wake again?â€

â€œTwice.â€

â€œBut could not fasten?â€

â€œDidnâ€™t want to try to: ainâ€™t one limb enough? What should I do
without this other arm? And Iâ€™m thinking Moby Dick doesnâ€™t bite so
much as he swallows.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ interrupted Bunger, â€œgive him your left arm for
bait to get the right. Do you know, gentlemenâ€â€”very gravely and
mathematically bowing to each Captain in successionâ€”â€œDo you know,
gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably
constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to
completely digest even a manâ€™s arm? And he knows it too. So that what
you take for the White Whaleâ€™s malice is only his awkwardness. For
he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by
feints. But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a
patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once
upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed
for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it
up in small tacks, dâ€™ye see. No possible way for him to digest that
jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.
Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind
to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial
to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale have
another chance at you shortly, thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œNo, thank ye, Bunger,â€ said the English Captain, â€œheâ€™s welcome
to the arm he has, since I canâ€™t help it, and didnâ€™t know him then;
but not to another one. No more White Whales for me; Iâ€™ve lowered
for him once, and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in
killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm
in him, but, hark ye, heâ€™s best let alone; donâ€™t you think so,
Captain?â€â€”glancing at the ivory leg.

â€œHe is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let
alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. Heâ€™s all
a magnet! How long since thou sawâ€™st him last? Which way heading?â€

â€œBless my soul, and curse the foul fiendâ€™s,â€ cried Bunger,
stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing;
â€œthis manâ€™s bloodâ€”bring the thermometer!â€”itâ€™s at the boiling
point!â€”his pulse makes these planks beat!â€”sir!â€â€”taking a lancet
from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahabâ€™s arm.

â€œAvast!â€ roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarksâ€”â€œMan the
boat! Which way heading?â€

â€œGood God!â€ cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
â€œWhatâ€™s the matter? He was heading east, I think.â€”Is your Captain
crazy?â€ whispering Fedallah.

But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
take the boatâ€™s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
towards him, commanded the shipâ€™s sailors to stand by to lower.

In a moment he was standing in the boatâ€™s stern, and the Manilla men
were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him.
With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own,
Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.
