standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him.

â€œWe must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working
loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?â€

â€œStrike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, Iâ€™d sway them up
now.â€

â€œSir!â€”in Godâ€™s name!â€”sir?â€

â€œWell.â€

â€œThe anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?â€

â€œStrike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind
rises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to
it.â€”By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of
some coasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots!
Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of
mine now sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but
cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh
aloft there! I would eâ€™en take it for sublime, did I not know that the
colic is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!â€
