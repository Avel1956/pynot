At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.

â€œDâ€™ye see him?â€ cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the
light to spread.

â€œSee nothing, sir.â€

â€œTurn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
for;â€”the top-gallant sails!â€”aye, they should have been kept on her
all night. But no matterâ€”â€˜tis but resting for the rush.â€

Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,
continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing
by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the
wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence
acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;
that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they
will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both
the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of
sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.
And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of
a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires
shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this
pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the
cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright
the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the
fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and
diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night
obscures the fish, the creatureâ€™s future wake through the darkness
is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the
pilotâ€™s coast is to him. So that to this hunterâ€™s wondrous skill,
the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all
desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the
mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in
its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as
doctors that of a babyâ€™s pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or
the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour;
even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that
other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his
speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have
gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of
latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful
in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whalemanâ€™s allies; for
of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill
that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from
his port? Inferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile
matters touching the chase of whales.

The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
field.

â€œBy salt and hemp!â€ cried Stubb, â€œbut this swift motion of the
deck creeps up oneâ€™s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I
are two brave fellows!â€”Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me,
spine-wise, on the sea,â€”for by live-oaks! my spineâ€™s a keel. Ha, ha!
we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!â€

â€œThere she blowsâ€”she blows!â€”she blows!â€”right ahead!â€ was now
the mast-head cry.

â€œAye, aye!â€ cried Stubb, â€œI knew itâ€”ye canâ€™t escapeâ€”blow on
and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow
your trumpâ€”blister your lungs!â€”Ahab will dam off your blood, as a
miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!â€

And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies
of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the
growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,
as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand
of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of
the previous day; the rack of the past nightâ€™s suspense; the fixed,
unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled
along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the
vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of
that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.

They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
though it was put together of all contrasting thingsâ€”oak, and maple,
and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hempâ€”yet all these ran into each
other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and
directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of
the crew, this manâ€™s valor, that manâ€™s fear; guilt and guiltiness,
all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that
fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.

The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,
shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking
yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to
seek out the thing that might destroy them!

â€œWhy sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?â€ cried Ahab, when,
after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been
heard. â€œSway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts
one odd jet that way, and then disappears.â€

It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its
pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the
air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant
halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, asâ€”much nearer to the ship
than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile aheadâ€”Moby Dick
bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not
by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White
Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon
of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths,
the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of
air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the
distance of seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged
waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his
act of defiance.

â€œThere she breaches! there she breaches!â€ was the cry, as in his
immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for
the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.

â€œAye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!â€ cried Ahab, â€œthy
hour and thy harpoon are at hand!â€”Down! down all of ye, but one man at
the fore. The boats!â€”stand by!â€

Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from
his perch.

â€œLower away,â€ he cried, so soon as he had reached his boatâ€”a
spare one, rigged the afternoon previous. â€œMr. Starbuck, the ship is
thineâ€”keep away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!â€

As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the
three crews. Ahabâ€™s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told
them he would take the whale head-and-head,â€”that is, pull straight
up to his forehead,â€”a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain
limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the whaleâ€™s
sidelong vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all
three boats were plain as the shipâ€™s three masts to his eye; the White
Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as
it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail,
offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted
at him from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each
separate plank of which those boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred,
incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for
a while eluded him; though, at times, but by a plankâ€™s breadth; while
all the time, Ahabâ€™s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to
shreds.

But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed
and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now
for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more
tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more
line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againâ€”hoping
that way to disencumber it of some snarlsâ€”when lo!â€”a sight more
savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!

Caught and twistedâ€”corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose
harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came
flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahabâ€™s boat.
Only one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically
reached withinâ€”throughâ€”and then, withoutâ€”the rays of steel;
dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and
then, twice sundering the rope near the chocksâ€”dropped the intercepted
fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the
White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other
lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of
Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two
rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the
sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the
odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the
grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.

While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while
aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his
legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily
singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old manâ€™s
lineâ€”now partingâ€”admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
rescue whom he could;â€”in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
concreted perils,â€”Ahabâ€™s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
Heaven by invisible wires,â€”as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its
bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell
againâ€”gunwale downwardsâ€”and Ahab and his men struggled out from
under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.

The first uprising momentum of the whaleâ€”modifying its direction as
he struck the surfaceâ€”involuntarily launched him along it, to a little
distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his
back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip
or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work
for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the
ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his
leeward way at a travellerâ€™s methodic pace.

As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and
safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and
ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable
intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there;
but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As
with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to
his boatâ€™s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor
did it so exhaust him as the previous dayâ€™s mishap.

But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory
leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.

â€œAye, aye, Starbuck, â€˜tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who
he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.â€

â€œThe ferrule has not stood, sir,â€ said the carpenter, now coming up;
â€œI put good work into that leg.â€

â€œBut no bones broken, sir, I hope,â€ said Stubb with true concern.

â€œAye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!â€”dâ€™ye see it.â€”But even
with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone
of mine one jot more me, than this dead one thatâ€™s lost. Nor white
whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own
proper and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast
scrape yonder roof?â€”Aloft there! which way?â€

â€œDead to leeward, sir.â€

â€œUp helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest
of the spare boats and rig themâ€”Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the
boatâ€™s crews.â€

â€œLet me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.â€

â€œOh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!â€

â€œSir?â€

â€œMy body, man, not thee. Give me something for a caneâ€”there, that
shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet.
By heaven it cannot be!â€”missing?â€”quick! call them all.â€

The old manâ€™s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
Parsee was not there.

â€œThe Parsee!â€ cried Stubbâ€”â€œhe must have been caught inâ€”â€

â€œThe black vomit wrench thee!â€”run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
forecastleâ€”find himâ€”not goneâ€”not gone!â€

But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
nowhere to be found.

â€œAye, sir,â€ said Stubbâ€”â€œcaught among the tangles of your
lineâ€”I thought I saw him dragging under.â€

â€œMy line! my line? Gone?â€”gone? What means that little word?â€”What
death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
The harpoon, too!â€”toss over the litter there,â€”dâ€™ye see it?â€”the
forged iron, men, the white whaleâ€™sâ€”no, no, no,â€”blistered fool!
this hand did dart it!â€”â€˜tis in the fish!â€”Aloft there! Keep him
nailedâ€”Quick!â€”all hands to the rigging of the boatsâ€”collect the
oarsâ€”harpooneers! the irons, the irons!â€”hoist the royals higherâ€”a
pull on all the sheets!â€”helm there! steady, steady for your life!
Iâ€™ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight
through it, but Iâ€™ll slay him yet!â€

â€œGreat God! but for one single instant show thyself,â€ cried
Starbuck; â€œnever, never wilt thou capture him, old manâ€”In Jesusâ€™
name no more of this, thatâ€™s worse than devilâ€™s madness. Two days
chased; twice stove to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from
under thee; thy evil shadow goneâ€”all good angels mobbing thee with
warnings:â€”

â€œWhat more wouldst thou have?â€”Shall we keep chasing this murderous
fish till he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the
bottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh,
oh,â€”Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!â€

â€œStarbuck, of late Iâ€™ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since
that hour we both sawâ€”thou knowâ€™st what, in one anotherâ€™s eyes.
But in this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the
palm of this handâ€”a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab,
man. This whole actâ€™s immutably decreed. â€˜Twas rehearsed by thee
and me a billion years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fatesâ€™
lieutenant; I act under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest
mine.â€”Stand round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump;
leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. â€˜Tis
Ahabâ€”his bodyâ€™s part; but Ahabâ€™s soulâ€™s a centipede, that moves
upon a hundred legs. I feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that
tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so. But ere I break,
yeâ€™ll hear me crack; and till ye hear that, know that Ahabâ€™s hawser
tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in the things called omens? Then
laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they drown, drowning things will
twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore. So
with Moby Dickâ€”two days heâ€™s floatedâ€”tomorrow will be the third.
Aye, men, heâ€™ll rise once more,â€”but only to spout his last! Dâ€™ye
feel brave men, brave?â€

â€œAs fearless fire,â€ cried Stubb.

â€œAnd as mechanical,â€ muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
muttered on: â€œThe things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same
to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I
seek to drive out of othersâ€™ hearts whatâ€™s clinched so fast
in mine!â€”The Parseeâ€”the Parsee!â€”gone, gone? and he was to go
before:â€”but still was to be seen again ere I could perishâ€”Howâ€™s
that?â€”Thereâ€™s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by
the ghosts of the whole line of judges:â€”like a hawkâ€™s beak it pecks
my brain. Iâ€™ll, Iâ€™ll solve it, though!â€

When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.

So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as
on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns
in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening
their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of
Ahabâ€™s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still
as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle;
his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat
due eastward for the earliest sun.
