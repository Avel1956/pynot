(Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow.)

â€œLad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is
coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee
by him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my
malady. Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most
desired health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,
as if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own
screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.â€

â€œNo, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain a
part of ye.â€

â€œOh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the
fadeless fidelity of man!â€”and a black! and crazy!â€”but methinks
like-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again.â€

â€œThey tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.
But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with
ye.â€

â€œIf thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahabâ€™s purpose keels up in
him. I tell thee no; it cannot be.â€

â€œOh good master, master, master!

â€œWeep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!â€”Met! True art
thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless
thee; and if it come to that,â€”God for ever save thee, let what will
befall.â€

(Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.)

â€œHere he this instant stood; I stand in his air,â€”but Iâ€™m alone.
Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but heâ€™s missing. Pip!
Pip! Ding, dong, ding! Whoâ€™s seen Pip? He must be up here; letâ€™s try
the door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet thereâ€™s no
opening it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told
me this screwed chair was mine. Here, then, Iâ€™ll seat me, against the
transom, in the shipâ€™s full middle, all her keel and her three masts
before me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours great
admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and
lieutenants. Ha! whatâ€™s this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all
come crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye; fill up,
monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now, when a black boyâ€™s host to white
men with gold lace upon their coats!â€”Monsieurs, have ye seen one
Pip?â€”a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly!
Jumped from a whale-boat once;â€”seen him? No! Well then, fill up again,
captains, and letâ€™s drink shame upon all cowards! I name no
names. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table. Shame upon all
cowards.â€”Hist! above there, I hear ivoryâ€”Oh, master! master! I am
indeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here Iâ€™ll stay, though
this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to
join me.â€
